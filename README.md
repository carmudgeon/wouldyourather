# Would You Rather Project

This is the project for the final assesment, the initial code was taken from the chirper project.

#### Steps to install

1) yarn install
2) yarn start
3) that's it you may open your browser at: http://localhost:3000/

4) Once in the dashboard, you'll see the title [] Unanswered questions, you should click on it in order to toggle between answered and unanswered polls

5) there is no 404 support, since i am allways validating the login status and if i try to go to a non existent page the page will reload and everything is reset

##### Note: There is a small mod in _DATA.js file as the users were not beign asigned the newly created questions...

```
users = {
    ...users,
    [formattedQuestion.author]: {
        ...users[formattedQuestion.author],
        questions: users[formattedQuestion.author].questions.concat([formattedQuestion.id])
    }
}
```
